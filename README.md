# hello-world
New repository
I am currently sitting on my couch at 12am after a stupid long day of work. Beer in hand I have decided to take a stab at freecodecamp.com. I am pleasantly suprised that we've jumped right in to getting started on learning tools. I'm excited to work with github, because my current occupation has programs within it's system that are similar; I work at a call center and occasionally script and edit accounts on the szeto system it uses. High hopes!
